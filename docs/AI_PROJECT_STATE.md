# AI Project State

This checkpoint lets a new conversation or agent resume from repository evidence without guessing. It records current state, not an implementation guide or a new architecture decision.

## Repository

- Repository: `siamese-lang/terraformers-platform`
- Default branch: `main`
- M0 closure evidence SHA: `3ccf17582ae91ad131d3efe8ce1a38492c401c72`

M0 closure was validated against this main SHA. Current `main` may differ after merge, so every new task must verify GitHub `main` again rather than treating this SHA as permanently current. It is not this PR's head SHA or a predicted merge SHA.

## Current milestone

- Milestone: **M3 — AI Evaluation Baseline**
- Status: **ACTIVE**
- Phase: fixed evaluation dataset construction
- Active plan: [M3 — AI Evaluation Baseline](plans/active/M3-ai-evaluation-baseline.md)
- Current implementation task: **M3-2 — Fixed/versioned evaluation dataset**

M0, M1, and M2 are complete. M3 is now the active milestone. Its first task defines the
fixed-evaluation contract needed to explain what the RAG pipeline used and where an observable
failure first occurred; it does not change prompt/retrieval/model behavior.

  - canonical Kubernetes/runtime-secret/deployment contracts were updated to neutral base keys, legacy Bedrock/S3/SQS enable switches were removed from the canonical selection contract, and historical AWS compatibility remains explicitly preserved; and
  - Backend Local Verification, MariaDB schema/repository validation, AWS Deployment Contract Inventory Verification, AWS Runtime Deployment Package Verification, and Terraform Static Verification — **PASS** at `b4e3c4cb0cf42e64904111447395f7a1435ca9aa`.
- M1-8 Contract/regression verification and closure — **COMPLETE**
  - dedicated closure verification passed provider-neutral boundary inspection plus full backend, MariaDB/Flyway/repository, frontend, and runtime-contract regressions;
  - closure inspection removed provider-specific failure types from the generic analysis lifecycle and preserved failure-message plus observability-category semantics through provider-neutral failure signals; and
  - M1 Cloud Decoupling Closure Verification, Backend Local Verification, Terraform Static Verification, and AWS Deployment Contract Inventory Verification — **PASS** at `d843fb9f08cd6255c1a4738ac220a40b5e760d75`.
- M2-1 Portable runtime baseline and parity gap inventory — **COMPLETE**
  - backend regression, MariaDB 11.4 + Flyway/schema/repository validation, frontend tests/build, and deterministic runtime-contract verification were **PASS** as distinct runtime identities;
  - Kind cluster creation and backend image build/load reached workload application, which then **FAIL**ed because namespace `terraformers-local` did not exist; downstream rollout/HTTP/auth/object-byte/active-provider paths remain **NOT COVERED** rather than inferred; and
  - M2 Runtime Parity Baseline evidence collection — **PASS** at `2623303347e15e580d83f583262c51d2573edbbd`, with the target Kind runtime failure preserved in the uploaded evidence.
- M2-2 Portable persistent runtime substrate — **COMPLETE**
  - added a separate self-contained `terraformers-portable` Kind fixture with MariaDB 11.4, canonical `prod` backend configuration, stub/disabled cloud adapters, fixture-only credentials, and no live cloud credentials;
  - namespace/apply, MariaDB readiness, backend rollout/readiness, health, Flyway schema history, and the existing repository smoke all passed against the same in-cluster MariaDB instance; and
  - M2 Portable Persistent Runtime Verification — **PASS** at `02a00efec167a92c8170e8787b68e28ce6dc2339`. The fixture deliberately does not claim DB restart durability, authentication/ownership, object-byte persistence, active provider behavior, or production topology.
- M2-3 Authenticated identity and ownership parity — **COMPLETE**
  - added a separate `portable-authenticated` Kind fixture with ephemeral RSA signing material and an in-cluster JWKS server, exercising the real JWT decoder/provider validator and existing external-identity mapping without a live IdP or cloud credential;
  - provider-plus-subject persistence, numeric internal user creation/reuse, distinct second identity, anonymous and invalid-token 401 rejection, owner/private access, non-owner 403 rejection, ownership modification checks, and display-name preservation all passed against the same portable MariaDB runtime; and
  - M2 Authenticated Identity Parity Verification — **PASS** at `eda4b9469f258b71aae8e28a0b3ec1a226c4412a`. Historical fixture/harness failures were fixed and rerun before closure.
- M2-4 Upload → analysis → Terraform result parity — **COMPLETE**
  - PR #24 first reproduced the current metadata-only limitation under an authenticated runtime: upload, analysis, Terraform validation, and inline result read-back passed, while source/result object bytes were not persisted and source reads returned 409;
  - added a JDK-only `filesystem` implementation behind the existing neutral `ObjectReader`/`ObjectWriter` ports and enabled it only in the `portable-object-store` test overlay, without selecting a production storage product; and
  - M2 Object Byte Storage Verification — **PASS** at `99fa2864ae3ef86536332172c4a3e50be612e686`: the same 68-byte source input round-tripped exactly, source/result rows recorded `binary_persisted=1`, source endpoints returned 200, the analysis job reached `SUCCEEDED`, and generated Terraform filesystem bytes matched the database/API checksum. The fixture is single-runtime evidence only and makes no restart/shared-storage durability claim.
- M2-5 User/project/comment and frontend experience parity — **COMPLETE**
  - the authoritative portable runtime matrix passed project list/get, private/public authorization, Terraform read/update/read-back, project tree, canonical and frontend-compatible comments, authenticated attribution, and deletion;
  - frontend Jest regression, production build, and built entrypoint passed, while the baseline isolated three provider-specific user-visible strings and classified browser E2E as not required for M2; and
  - the frontend-only follow-up at `7d8cdf357cb16a9073c86c6eb5140e617219180d` removed the Cognito/Bedrock/`s3://` presentation leakage without changing APIs or provider selection. M2 User Experience Baseline Verification run #5 then passed with all three provider-neutral classifications `PASS`, `known_provider_specific_visible_copy=0`, and `first_confirmed_gap=none`.
- M2-6 Runtime parity closure — **COMPLETE**
  - reviewed the accepted M2-1 through M2-5 evidence against all 14 M2 exit criteria without adding a closure-specific verifier or workflow;
  - confirmed no subsequent production/runtime change invalidated the latest successful M2-5 claims; and
  - [M2 Runtime Parity Closure](verification/m2-runtime-parity-closure.md) records **PASS** with explicit residual limitations.
- M3-1 Evaluation contract and stage-provenance schema — **COMPLETE**
  - added one provider-neutral case/result contract for extraction, retrieval, generation, and validation provenance;
  - retained retrieved document score/source/authority/risk metadata and explicit first-observable-divergence classification; and
  - [M3 Evaluation Contract v1](evaluation/m3-evaluation-contract-v1.md) plus `EvaluationContractTest` cover success and four representative failure locations without changing production AI behavior.

## Verified architectural direction

This project is **not** a greenfield rewrite, a simple AWS-to-GCP migration, or a technology-count expansion exercise. It **is** modernization of the existing Terraformers system through reuse of existing domain/business flows, a provider-neutral logical architecture, a current GCP deployment target, reproduced-failure-based backend reliability work, fixed-evaluation-based AI/RAG work, actual-RCA-based observability, and cloud portability. The Spring Boot application remains the logical center.

Reuse the domain/project/user/file/comment flow, `AnalysisJob` lifecycle baseline, MariaDB + Flyway, `AnalysisProvider`, `EmbeddingProvider`, `ReferenceRetriever`, `ObjectReader`/`ObjectWriter`, Terraform draft validation, versioned RAG corpus/contract, Kubernetes-compatible workload contract, and deterministic test/validation assets.

## Current gaps

M3 activation inspection found these AI/RAG measurement gaps:

- no fixed/versioned AI evaluation dataset exists;
- the current pipeline is `image → extracted architecture facts → retrieval query → embedding/OpenSearch → ranked references → generation → Terraform validation`;
- extracted architecture facts and retrieval query are not retained in the final result;
- retrieved `ReferenceDocument` objects contain score, authority, source path, corpus/provider
  version, priority, resource types, and risk tags, but `AnalysisResult` currently retains only
  reference IDs;
- current logs expose useful counts/IDs but do not provide one per-case provenance chain through
  extraction, retrieval, generation, and validation;
- there is no explicit evidence mapping that lets a failed generated resource be classified as an
  extraction, retrieval, grounding, generation, or validation problem;
- `terraformers-reference-v2` currently contains 128 documents (90 provider documentation, 30
  provider schema, 8 project decisions); that corpus identity is a baseline input, not a new active
  cloud-provider decision;
- LangChain/LangGraph remain evidence-gated. M3 first measures the existing linear Spring Boot
  pipeline; framework adoption is considered only if measured failures justify it.

## Historical AWS implementation

Cognito, Amplify Cognito integration, Bedrock, S3, the SQS adapter, AOSS/SigV4, CloudWatch, AWS Terraform runtime stacks, EKS-specific integrations, and AWS delivery/deploy/teardown workflows are **HISTORICAL** compatibility/baseline/reference assets, not the active target. Do not assume they must be deleted.

Reusable patterns include provider abstraction, immutable image/SHA identity, least privilege, state separation, approval gates, plan/apply separation, deterministic validation, and deployment/rollback/teardown evidence.

## Deferred / gated decisions

**DEFER — evidence required:** RabbitMQ, Transactional Outbox, LangGraph, a persistent Python AI worker/service, Keycloak, Redis, Kafka, and multi-agent architecture.

**GCP deployment GATED:** GKE use and mode/topology, node count, VM type/size, concrete managed database hosting, object storage implementation, exact identity provider, OpenSearch hosting/auth/network topology, generation and embedding model/providers, exact observability deployment topology, ingress/load-balancer product, exact secret/runtime identity product, and exact CI federation/registry implementation.

Do not invent TPS or latency targets, AI quality-improvement percentages, or node/resource counts. None of these deferred or gated decisions is selected by this state document.

## Capacity and quota status

Repository evidence contains no actual values, so each deployment gate remains `UNKNOWN/TBD`:

- GCP billing / Free Trial status and project/region;
- CPU and persistent-disk quotas;
- IP and load-balancer constraints;
- GKE feasibility/quota;
- OpenSearch and observability resource budgets; and
- model API availability/quota.

Do not infer the user's account state.

## Remaining M0 work

No remaining M0 work.

## Remaining M1 work

No remaining M1 work.

## Immediate next work

**M3-2 — Fixed/versioned evaluation dataset.** Add the smallest representative set of architecture,
ambiguous, and non-architecture fixtures using [M3 Evaluation Contract v1](evaluation/m3-evaluation-contract-v1.md).
Each case must carry stable input identity and enough expectations to localize extraction, retrieval,
generation, and validation outcomes.

Do not tune prompts, retrieval ranking, corpus contents, model choice, or production orchestration
while creating the dataset.

## Do not revisit

Without new evidence, an ADR where needed, and the change gate, do not:

- turn the project into a greenfield rewrite or reduce it to a simple AWS-to-GCP migration;
- split the Spring Boot-centered structure into microservices;
- replace MariaDB with PostgreSQL or another database;
- redesign existing domain/business flows;
- discard `AnalysisProvider`, `EmbeddingProvider`, `ReferenceRetriever`, or `ObjectReader`/`ObjectWriter`;
- introduce LangGraph/agent architecture before AI evaluation;
- introduce RabbitMQ/outbox before reliability evidence;
- assume Keycloak is the default IdP;
- select a GCP product/topology without quota evidence;
- replace Terraform with OpenTofu; or
- restore the historical AWS stack as the active deployment target.

“Do not revisit” is not a permanent ban; it prevents reopening accepted direction arbitrarily without new evidence, the required ADR, and the change gate.

## Working rules

Before any future task: (1) verify current GitHub `main` SHA, (2) read `AGENTS.md`, (3) read this
document, (4) read `MASTER_PLAN.md`, and (5) read the
[active M3 plan](plans/active/M3-ai-evaluation-baseline.md). Start with its first incomplete task
and do not absorb M4 improvement work into M3 baseline collection. Retain the
[completed M2 plan](plans/active/M2-runtime-parity.md) and [completed M1 plan](plans/active/M1-cloud-decoupling.md)
as historical milestone evidence.

For a substantive change, record an observed problem, reproducible evidence, a change that directly addresses it, and same-condition revalidation. Establish a fixed evaluation baseline before AI changes, reproduce a failure before reliability changes, and require diagnosis evidence—not dashboard count—for observability completion.
